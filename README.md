# Employee Attrition Prediction  

## Overview  
The **Employee Attrition Prediction** project aims to help organizations anticipate employee turnover by using historical data and machine learning models. It classifies employees as "Active" or "Not Active" to assist HR teams in identifying and addressing potential attrition risks.  

### Key Features  
- **Attrition Prediction**: Forecast whether an employee will stay or leave the organization.  
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Visualizations for monitoring attrition trends and employee demographics.  

## Business Objectives  
1. Accurately predict employee attrition using machine learning.  
2. Provide data-driven insights to support workforce planning.  

## Data Description  
The project integrates data from multiple sources:  
1. **Employee Data**: Personal and professional details.  
2. **Training Data**: Records of employee training programs.  
3. **Recruitment Data**: Insights into hiring processes.  
4. **Engagement Survey Data**: Employee satisfaction and engagement metrics.  

### Preprocessing Steps  
- Data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering.  
- Encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features.  

## Machine Learning Approach  
Three classifiers were tested:  
1. **Random Forest**  
2. **Gradient Boosting**  
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  

The SVM model was selected for its high accuracy and robust performance. It achieved an accuracy of **96.83%**, with balanced precision and recall metrics.  

## Dashboards  
Power BI dashboards were created to provide actionable insights into:  
- Employee attrition trends.  
- Key attrition factors such as roles and departments.
